ShabBOT
====

Helps coordinate Shabbat meals in the [Orthodox Community at Penn](https://www.pennocp.org/) (OCP).
---

Every week, the ShabBOT emails ten people at random* to invite them to a Shabbat meal.

\* In order to keep things fair, the algorithm actually uses a weighted probability distribution function based on [frecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency).
