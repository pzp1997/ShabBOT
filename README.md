ShabBOT
====

Helps coordinate Shabbat meals in the [Orthodox Community at Penn](https://www.pennocp.org/) (OCP).
---

Every week, the ShabBOT emails ten people at random* to invite them to a Shabbat meal.

<span style="font-size: 0.75em">\* In order to keep things fair, the algorithm actually uses a weighted probability distribution function based on recency, i.e. you have a better shot at being invited to a meal if you have not been invited in a while.</span>
